# eelchat

This is the code for [the Biff
tutorial](https://biffweb.com/docs/tutorial/build-a-forum/).
See [the commits](https://github.com/jacobobryant/eelchat/commits/master) to view the
code from a specific part of the tutorial.

Run `bb dev` to get started. You'll need to copy your own `config.edn` file
here first. See `bb tasks` for other commands.
